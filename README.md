# Python Autoclicker
This is an autoclicker made with Python using the tkinter, keyboard, pyautogui, time, and threading modules.

**Note: THIS AUTOCLICKER IS PRETTY BAD COMPARED TO OTHER AUTOCLICKERS. IF YOU WANT TO USE AN ACTUALLY GOOD AUTOCLICKER, USE SOMETHING ELSE.**

Nevertheless, nothing's stopping you from using this (bad) autoclicker.

This autoclicker has a click speed of 10 CPS. Using it is pretty simple. First you choose a key, time delay, and which mouse button you want to press. Then you press the chosen key to toggle clicking.
